        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          Sasi cakes is a bakery shop run by three childhood friends; Sasi Sarah
          and Simon. Baking Cakes was the only thing they were serious about, so
          after High School, instead of going to College, They went to Bakery
          School. After a year of learning, They opened their small bakery
          business at home, baking cakes at home and selling them. After eigth
          months, Sasi Cakes open their first cake shop in 2019 at a local
          town called Bakau, but now we have three shops in different
          locations. So we are hiring more people now, If you are looking for a job and love baking do contact us. 
          <p>
            We offer you to experience true pleasure, We make cakes,
          cupcakes, cookies and more.Our mission is to make people happy. Making
          delicious cakes, having relaxing chairs in a smoking free environment
          and keeping our prices reasonable are all different ways to achieve
          this goal.
